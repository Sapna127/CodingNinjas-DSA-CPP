You have been given two integer arrays/lists (ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words,
when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

------------------------

#include <unordered_map>
void printIntersection(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
{
    // Write your code here
    unordered_map<int, int> ourmap;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        ourmap[arr1[i]]++;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        if (ourmap.find(arr2[i]) != ourmap.end())
        {
            cout << arr2[i] << endl;
            ourmap[arr2[i]]--;
            if (ourmap[arr2[i]] == 0)
                ourmap.erase(arr2[i]);
        }
    }
}
